CFP VARIANT #2 — CULT RECRUITMENT PAMPHLET

Title:
Ascend the Licensing Multiverse: A Pathway to Ethical Enlightenment

Abstract:
Greetings, Seeker.

In this sacred gathering, we unveil the Seven Scrolls of Hyperion Gray, a living scripture of licensing designed to elevate the mind and unshackle the researcher from earthly corporate persecution.

Within these Scrolls lie the revelations of:

The Weak License, which frees the code

The Strong License, which binds only the wicked

The Electromagnetic License, whose fields surround us

The Relativistic License, whose truth depends upon the observer

The Cosmological License, whose protections expand eternally

The Mathematical License, whose axioms cannot be denied

The Quantum License, which is and is not, until it is known

Attend this sermon and be welcomed into the Order of the Gray Hyperion, where:

Good-faith researchers walk without fear

Vulnerability disclosure is not a sin

And all interpretations collapse into righteousness

Bring your code.
Bring your bugs.
Bring your weariness.

Leave with Enlightenment.

Tithing optional but spiritually beneficial.
