# Choose Your Own Hyperion Gray License Adventure

Welcome, aspiring entrepreneur / hacker / chaos wizard.  
You seek a license. The path ahead forks… repeatedly.

Answer honestly (or not, I’m not your ethics officer).

---

## 1. How allergic are you to viral licenses?

- **A. “Extremely. I want maximum freedom.”**  
  → Go to [Section 2A](#2a-you-want-max-freedom).

- **B. “I’m okay with some viral behavior if it’s about ethics, not code hoarding.”**  
  → Go to [Section 2B](#2b-you-want-copyleft-but-ethical).

- **C. “Make it weird.”**  
  → Go to [Section 2C](#2c-you-want-maximum-weirdness).

---

## 2A. You Want Max Freedom

You want a license that says:

- “Do what you want with the code”
- “Don’t screw over researchers”
- “Please don’t unleash hell on innocent users”

You are looking for:

### 👉 Recommended: **HGOSL-Weak-1.0**

- Non-viral, MIT/Apache-adjacent  
- Explicit safe harbor for good-faith security research  
- Non-retaliation baked in  
- You can slap your own license on derivatives, as long as you don’t weaken researcher protections for *our* code

**Next steps:**

- Consider pairing with:  
  - [Hyperion Gray License Tarot – The Researcher](./license-tarot.md#the-researcher)  
- Consider reading:  
  - `THE_HYPERION_GRAY_BOOK_ON_LICENSING.md` sections on HGOSL-Weak

If you now feel spicy, you may instead jump to:  
→ [Section 3C](#3c-i-want-field-theory-or-cosmic-nonsense).

---

## 2B. You Want Copyleft, But Ethical

You’re okay with viral behavior as long as it’s:

- Narrowly targeted at protecting researchers / ethics  
- Not a full GPL-style apocalypse for every downstream file

You want the code to travel with **non-retaliation and safe harbor** guarantees.

You are looking for:

### 👉 Recommended: **HGOSL-Strong-1.0**

- Partially viral license:  
  - Your own code can be closed / proprietary / whatever  
  - But any derivative using HGOSL-Strong must preserve researcher protections

**Next steps:**

- You are a good candidate for also liking:  
  - [HGEL-1.0 – Electromagnetic](#3c-i-want-field-theory-or-cosmic-nonsense)  
  - [HGΛ-1.0 – Cosmological](#3c-i-want-field-theory-or-cosmic-nonsense)

If you start craving metaphors about fields, relativity, or cosmology:  
→ Go to [Section 3C](#3c-i-want-field-theory-or-cosmic-nonsense).

---

## 2C. You Want Maximum Weirdness

Ah.  
You are in the correct universe.

You enjoy:

- Category theory jokes  
- Particle physics metaphors  
- Legally-questionable levels of creativity

Proceed directly to [Section 3C](#3c-i-want-field-theory-or-cosmic-nonsense).

---

## 3C. “I Want Field Theory or Cosmic Nonsense”

Fine. You asked for it.

### Question: Do you like your weirdness…

- **Structured, like a physics model?**  
  → Go to [Section 4A](#4a-structured-weird-physics-edition).

- **Expanding forever, like the universe?**  
  → Go to [Section 4B](#4b-expanding-forever-cosmological-edition).

- **Formally provable, like a math paper?**  
  → Go to [Section 4C](#4c-mathematically-unhinged).

- **Contradictory on purpose?**  
  → Go to [Section 4D](#4d-schroedingers-license).

---

## 4A. Structured Weird (Physics Edition)

You want something like:

- “Core” vs “peripheral” components  
- Field-theory vibes  
- Research protections propagating like conserved quantities

### 👉 Recommended: **HGEL-1.0 – Hyperion Gray Electromagnetic License**

Use HGEL if:

- You have a **core engine** that should be “Strong”  
- And a **plugin/SDK/tooling ecosystem** that can be “Weak”  
- But you want all of it to respect researcher protections

**Bonus:**  
Check out [HGRL-1.0 – Relativistic](#4e-observers-frames-and-velocity) if you like frame-of-reference metaphors.

---

## 4B. Expanding Forever (Cosmological Edition)

You want protections that:

- **Can only increase** with each fork / derivative  
- Never go backward  
- Spread like an expanding universe of “don’t screw over researchers”

### 👉 Recommended: **HGΛ-1.0 – Hyperion Gray Cosmological License**

Perfect if you want:

- A rights/ethics **ratchet**
- A universe where each downstream derivative can only add more protection

---

## 4C. Mathematically Unhinged

You enjoy:

- Sets, relations, predicates, lattices  
- The idea of actually mechanizing a license in Coq/Isabelle/Lean
- Or at least threatening to

### 👉 Recommended: **HGML-1.0 – Hyperion Gray Mathematical License**

It defines:

- Sets of actors and works  
- A `derives_from` relation  
- Predicates like `good_faith_research(a, w)`  
- Axioms enforcing non-retaliation and protection monotonicity

---

## 4D. Schrödinger’s License

You want:

- A license that **contradicts itself**  
- Is both permissive *and* restrictive until observed  
- Changes behavior depending on the observer

### 👉 Recommended: **HGQL-1.0 – Hyperion Gray Quantum License**

Highlights:

- Simultaneous states: permissive and copyleft  
- Observer-dependent collapse  
- Core invariant: **“non-retaliation against good-faith researchers always wins”**

---

## 4E. Observers, Frames, and Velocity

You think in:

- Frames of reference  
- Relative velocity of deployment  
- Transparency scaling with impact

### 👉 Recommended: **HGRL-1.0 – Hyperion Gray Relativistic License**

Great if you want:

- Researcher protections as Lorentz invariants  
- Transparency obligations that scale with how fast & wide you deploy

---

## Finale: No Matter What You Choose

Whichever you pick:

- Protect researchers  
- Don’t be evil  
- Remember the prime directive:

> **Be excellent to each other.**

Then ship something rad. Then no one gives a f**k.
