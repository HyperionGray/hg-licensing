# The Hyperion Gray Book on Licensing:
## A (Not Really) Legal Approach to Chaotic Licensing for the Aspiring Entrepreneur

---

# FOREWORD(S)

Below are several forewords of varying tone and intention.  
This book exists in superposition until you choose one.  

Some may or may not have been written by AI. If you can guess which, you get hacker gear and hoodies shipped to your house. AndBut also not really, I'm not sending hacker gear. And hoodies are expensive. So just like, reward yourself in your head, it's more fulfilling or something.

## Foreword A — Arrogantly Academic

Over the past several decades, software licenses have evolved from “kindly do not sue me” notes into sprawling documents that threaten to eclipse *War and Peace* in girth, but not in meaning.

In this desert of boilerplate, we offer something different: a family of licenses that—brace yourself—actually acknowledges reality.

Namely:  
**Security researchers exist. They are not cryptids. They should not be punished for noticing your mistakes.**

If this offends you, please feel free to fork the code and apply your own license that expresses your personal discomfort more thoroughly.

For everyone else: welcome.  
Enjoy the ride.

## Foreword B — Corporate Smarm

At Hyperion Gray™, we believe in *innovation*, *community*, and pretending to care about *responsible disclosure* until a researcher finds something truly embarrassing.

That’s why we created the Hyperion Gray License Universe: a suite of licensing instruments scientifically engineered to:

- empower developers,  
- enable researchers,  
- and prevent us from being sued for any of this.

Please enjoy these licenses in the spirit intended:  
a delicate balance of legal defensibility, performative altruism, and the timeless principle:

**“Don’t be a jerk.”**

Thank you for choosing Hyperion Gray.  
A wholly imaginary subsidiary of No One Can Stop Us, LLC.

## Foreword C — Hacker Zine Vibe

Look, we all know how this goes.  
A company ships something dumb.  
A researcher finds a vuln.  
Somebody threatens to sue somebody else.

And through all this, license texts remain untouched, fossilized, and useless.

So we fixed that.

The Hyperion Gray License Universe exists so that:

- researchers can do research,  
- developers can build cool things,  
- and litigious weirdos can go yell into a bucket instead of at security folks.

Fork it. Ship it. Break it. Improve it.

Just don’t be evil about it.

---

## Foreword D — Smug Philosopher-King

For centuries—yes, centuries— probably millenia, I'm not great with history or numbers-
humans have attempted to encode their values into law.
Usually with mixed results. See also: every software license ever written.

With the HG License Universe, we humbly submit a new approach:  
**make the license actually say the thing you believe.**

We believe in researcher rights.  
We believe in user protection.  
We believe that companies should feel the consequences of shipping garbage.

And if that means your lawyers sweat a little—excellent. That means they read it.

Let the universe expand.

---

## Foreword E — Quantum Meta-Foreword

This foreword exists in a state of superposition.

Until you observe it, it is simultaneously:

- earnest,  
- sarcastic,  
- hostile to corporations,  
- overly academic,  
- dangerously sincere,  
- and not legally binding.

If you find contradictions, good. That means it’s working.

The Hyperion Gray License Universe demands only one thing:

**Do not retaliate against good-faith security researchers.**

Everything else is negotiable, except suing or arresting us, that's not cool either. 
That's against the license.

Collapse the waveform when ready.

## 0. Intent (Frames of Reference)

This License treats different stakeholders as observers in different frames of
reference: researchers, users, vendors, regulators, etc.

Some obligations depend on the “velocity” and “scale” of distribution, but the
following are **frame-invariant**:

- The right to perform good-faith security research
- The prohibition on retaliation against good-faith researchers
- The principle that law supersedes this License
- A baseline of ethical use

Any interpretation must preserve these invariants.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Software**: The code, documentation, binaries, or other materials
  distributed under this License.

- **Observer**: Any individual or entity interacting with the Software,
  including but not limited to: developers, maintainers, companies, users,
  researchers, regulators, courts.

- **Frame of Reference**: The role from which an Observer approaches the
  Software (e.g., “researcher frame”, “vendor frame”, “regulator frame”).

- **Good-faith security research**: Testing, analysis, or disclosure performed
  to understand, improve, or communicate security posture without intent to
  harm uninvolved parties.

- **Velocity of Distribution**: The breadth and speed with which the Software
  or derivative works are deployed or redistributed (e.g., internal only vs.
  public Internet-wide deployment).

---

## 2. Permission Grant

In any frame of reference, you are permitted to:

- use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies
  of the Software,

subject to the Conditions below.

---

## 3. Frame-Invariant Ethical Boundaries

In all frames of reference, you **may not** use the Software in ways that
deliberately harm uninvolved third parties, including:

- violating another person or entity’s privacy or rights,
- exploiting vulnerabilities for personal gain that results in harm,
- harassment, intimidation, or actions violating the rights or safety of others.

Nothing in this section prohibits good-faith security research, controlled
testing, or analysis performed within ethical boundaries.

These constraints are invariant across observers and do not change with
velocity of distribution.

---

## 4. Security Research as a Relativistic Invariant

Regardless of observer frame:

- Security research involving the Software is explicitly permitted.
- Researchers retain full ownership and control of their findings.
- No interpretation of this License may be used to limit:
  - the right to study, test, or analyze the Software,
  - the right to publish advisories, demonstrations, or technical analyses,
  - the right to privately or publicly disclose vulnerabilities,
  - the right to communicate findings with peers, conferences, or the community.

---

## 5. No Forced Disclosure (Gauge Symmetry)

Observers may *request* vulnerability disclosure but may not *compel* it under
this License.

- Coordinated disclosure may be encouraged as a matter of practice,
  but is never a licensing requirement.
- This rule is symmetric across frames: maintainers, vendors, and users do not
  gain any special license-based power to force disclosure.

---

## 6. Non-Retaliation (Invariant Under Transformation)

In any frame of reference, the following is prohibited:

- threatening, suing, or otherwise retaliating against individuals who:
  - perform good-faith security research,
  - disclose vulnerabilities ethically or in good faith (including public disclosure),
  - demonstrate findings for educational, defensive, or protective purposes.

This clause is invariant under changes in observer frame or distribution
velocity.

---

## 7. Velocity-Dependent Transparency

The faster and farther you deploy or redistribute the Software or derivative
works, the stronger your obligations for transparency become:

1. **Low velocity / limited internal use**  
   - Reasonable internal documentation is encouraged but not required.

2. **Moderate velocity / limited external use**  
   - You should document known security assumptions and encourage safe usage.

3. **High velocity / large-scale or public deployment**  
   - You must:
     - clearly inform users that the system may be subject to security research,
     - acknowledge researcher rights and non-retaliation,
     - avoid misleading claims about “unhackability” or guaranteed security.

These transparency duties scale with impact, but do not negate or weaken
researcher protections.

---

## 8. Legal Supremacy (Boundary Condition)

Wherever applicable law and this License conflict, **law prevails**.

This License must not be interpreted as permitting or excusing illegal activity.

---

## 9. Attribution

If you distribute the Software or derivative works:

1. Include a copy of this License.
2. Clearly indicate which portions derive from the Software.
3. Do not misrepresent the philosophy or intent of the authors.

---

## 10. Trademarks

Nothing in this License grants permission to use Hyperion Gray trademarks,
names, or logos without separate written consent.

---

## 11. Warranty Disclaimer

The Software is provided “AS IS,” without warranties of any kind, express or
implied. Use at your own risk.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim,
damages, or other liability arising from use of the Software.

---

## 13. Severability

If any portion of this License is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
sections continue to apply in all frames of reference.

---

## 14. Be Excellent to Each Other (Rest Frame)

Regardless of your frame, the preferred ground state is respect, honesty,
and ethical conduct.

# 5. HGΛ-1.0 – Hyperion Gray Cosmological License

# Hyperion Gray Cosmological License (HGΛ-1.0)

SPDX-License-Identifier: HGAL-1.0  
Copyright © [YEAR] Hyperion Gray

## 0. Intent (Cosmological Principle)

This License treats the ecosystem of derivative works as an expanding universe.

Its core idea:

- Good-faith security researcher protections form a **cosmological constant**:
  a minimum level of rights that never decreases.
- As the Software is forked, extended, and remixed, that constant can only
  increase, not shrink.
- No downstream license may weaken protections for good-faith researchers
  below those in this License.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Software**: The code, documentation, binaries, or other materials
  distributed under this License.

- **Derivative Work**: Any work that incorporates, modifies, links to, or is
  otherwise based on the Software.

- **Protection Level**: The set of rights and guarantees afforded to
  good-faith security researchers under a given license.

- **Good-faith security research**: Testing, analysis, or disclosure performed
  to understand, improve, or communicate security posture without intent to
  harm uninvolved parties.

---

## 2. Permission Grant

You are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
and/or sell copies of the Software for any purpose, subject to the Conditions
below.

---

## 3. Ethical Use

You may not use the Software in ways that deliberately harm uninvolved third
parties, including:

- violating another person or entity’s privacy or rights,
- exploitation of vulnerabilities for personal gain that results in harm,
- harassment, intimidation, or actions violating the rights or safety of others.

Nothing in this section prohibits good-faith security research, controlled
testing, or analysis performed within ethical boundaries.

---

## 4. Baseline Researcher Protections (Cosmological Constant)

This License establishes a baseline protection level for good-faith security
researchers that includes:

1. Permission to perform good-faith security research on the Software.  
2. Permission to publish, privately or publicly disclose, and discuss findings.  
3. No licensing-based requirement to notify maintainers or vendors.  
4. A prohibition on retaliation against good-faith researchers.

This baseline is the **cosmological constant**: it may be increased, but not
decreased, by derivative licenses.

---

## 5. Expansion Principle for Derivative Works

If you distribute a Derivative Work:

1. You may change the overall license terms, **provided that**:
   - the protection level for good-faith security researchers is at least as
     strong as the baseline in Section 4.

2. If you **strengthen** protections (e.g., add broader safe-harbor language,
   more explicit non-retaliation, or clearer autonomy), that stronger set of
   protections becomes the new “local constant” for that Derivative Work.

3. Any further Derivative Works of your Derivative must then provide protections
   at least as strong as **your** protection level.

In other words: researcher rights may only expand or remain constant across
descendants, never shrink.

---

## 6. No Forced Disclosure

Researchers are not required by this License to disclose vulnerabilities to
anyone. Coordinated disclosure may be appreciated, but it is not mandatory.

---

## 7. Non-Retaliation

You may not, under this License:

- threaten, sue, or retaliate against individuals who:
  - perform good-faith security research,
  - disclose vulnerabilities ethically or in good faith (including public disclosure),
  - demonstrate findings for educational, defensive, or protective purposes.

This non-retaliation principle is part of the cosmological constant and may not
be weakened by derivative licenses.

---

## 8. Legal Supremacy

If any law conflicts with this License, applicable law prevails.

This License must not be interpreted as permitting or excusing illegal activity.

---

## 9. Attribution and Lineage

If you distribute the Software or a Derivative Work:

1. Include a copy of this License or a superseding license with protections at
   least as strong for good-faith researchers.
2. Indicate that the work descends from Software covered by the Hyperion Gray
   Cosmological License.
3. Do not misrepresent the philosophy or intent of the authors.

---

## 10. Trademarks

Nothing in this License grants rights to use Hyperion Gray trademarks, names, or
logos without separate written consent.

---

## 11. Warranty Disclaimer

The Software is provided “AS IS,” without warranties of any kind, express or
implied. Use at your own risk.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim,
damages, or other liability arising from use of the Software.

---

## 13. Heat Death Clause

If, at some distant point, the ecosystem of derived works reaches a state where
researcher protections cannot meaningfully be improved further, the cosmological
constant remains at its maximum and this License peacefully coasts along with it.

---

## 14. Be Excellent to Each Other

As the universe of code expands, try not to be the black hole.

## 1. Basic Sets and Relations

Let:

- **A** be the set of all actors (individuals or entities).  
- **W** be the set of all works (code, documentation, binaries, etc.).  
- **S ⊆ W** be the subset of works distributed under this License (“the Software”).  
- **D ⊆ W** be the set of derivative works of S.  

We define a relation:

- `derives_from ⊆ W × W` where `(w₂, w₁) ∈ derives_from` means “w₂ is a derivative
  of w₁” in the usual software sense (incorporation, modification, linkage, or
  other substantive dependence).

We define predicates:

- `good_faith_research(a, w)` meaning actor `a ∈ A` is performing security research
  on work `w ∈ W` with intent to improve security, inform, or protect, and not to
  harm uninvolved parties.

- `retaliation(a_target, a_source)` meaning `a_target` undertakes legal or other
  punitive action against `a_source` specifically due to `a_source` performing
  good-faith research or disclosure.

---

## 2. Permission Grant (Informal Statement)

Any actor `a ∈ A` is permitted to:

- use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies
  of any `s ∈ S`,

subject to the Constraints and Axioms below.

Informally: You can basically do what you want with the Software, as long as you
respect the axioms.

---

## 3. Ethical Constraint

We state the following *ethical constraint*:

For all `a ∈ A`, `w ∈ W`:

- `a` must not use `w` in ways that deliberately harm uninvolved third parties,
  including:
  - violating privacy or rights,
  - exploiting vulnerabilities for personal gain in a way that results in harm,
  - harassment, intimidation, or violation of safety.

This constraint does not prohibit `good_faith_research(a, w)`.

---

## 4. Axioms of Researcher Protection

### Axiom 1 (Permissibility of Good-Faith Research)

For all `a ∈ A`, `w ∈ W`:

- If `good_faith_research(a, w)` then such activity is **permitted** under this
  License, subject to applicable law.

### Axiom 2 (Ownership of Research Output)

For all `a ∈ A`, `w ∈ W`:

- If `good_faith_research(a, w)` then `a` retains ownership and control over
  the resulting findings, analysis, and expressions.

### Axiom 3 (Non-Retaliation)

For all `a₁, a₂ ∈ A`, `w ∈ W`:

- If `good_faith_research(a₂, w)` and `retaliation(a₁, a₂)` is undertaken **solely**
  because of that good-faith research or disclosure, then such retaliation is
  prohibited by this License.

Informally: you don’t get to punish people just because they exposed your bugs.

### Axiom 4 (No Forced Disclosure)

For all `a ∈ A`, `w ∈ W`:

- If `good_faith_research(a, w)`, this License does **not** impose any obligation
  on `a` to report vulnerabilities to the authors or maintainers of `w`.

(Other obligations may arise from law or separate agreements; this License does
not create such an obligation.)

---

## 5. Derivative Work Constraint

For all `w₁, w₂ ∈ W`:

- If `(w₂, w₁) ∈ derives_from` and `w₁ ∈ S`, then any license applied to `w₂`
  must **not** weaken the effective protections implied by Axioms 1–4 for
  good-faith researchers.

Put differently:

- Let `P(w)` be the set of practical rights and protections afforded to
  good-faith researchers with respect to `w`.  
- Then, if `w₂` is derived from `w₁`, any valid license for `w₂` must satisfy:

\[
P(w₂) \supseteq P(w₁)
\]

in the lattice of protections.

---

## 6. Legal Supremacy

This License is subordinate to applicable law.

If any law conflicts with a clause or axiom here:

- The conflicting clause is considered inapplicable to the extent of the conflict.
- The remaining clauses continue to hold, where consistent with law.

---

## 7. Attribution

If you distribute any `w₂ ∈ W` such that `(w₂, w₁) ∈ derives_from` for some
`w₁ ∈ S`:

1. You must include a copy of this License.  
2. You must indicate that `w₂` derives from Software under the Hyperion Gray
   Mathematical License (HGML-1.0).  
3. You must not misrepresent the authors’ philosophy or intent.

---

## 8. Trademarks

This License does not grant rights to use Hyperion Gray trademarks, names, or
logos without separate written consent.

---

## 9. Warranty Disclaimer

For all `w ∈ S`:

- `w` is provided “AS IS,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.
- Use is at the risk of the user.

---

## 10. Limitation of Liability

For all `w ∈ S`:

- The authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or
  other liability arising from use of `w`.

---

## 11. Severability

If any clause, axiom, or definition in this License is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining parts remain in effect, provided that the core
researcher protections expressed in Axioms 1–4 are preserved to the maximum
extent allowed by law.

---

## 12. Informal Restatement

All this formality aside, the intention is simple:

- You can use this Software however you want,
- as long as you don’t weaponize it against people,
- and you never screw over good-faith security researchers.

The rest is details.
