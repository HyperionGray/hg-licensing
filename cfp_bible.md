📖 CFP VARIANT #4 — BIBLICAL SCRIPTURE EDITION

Title:
The Book of Hyperion: Licensing According to the Gray Covenant

Abstract:

And lo, in the days of corporate wrath, when researchers wandered the desert of Cease-and-Desists,

There arose from the void a text, forged in caffeine and righteous indignation.

And the text spake thus:
“Thou shalt not smite the researcher who discovers thy vulnerabilities.”

And the people rejoiced, for the Law was finally written plainly.

In this sermon, we shall read from the Seven Licenses:

The Weak License, which granteth freedom

The Strong License, which endureth

The Electromagnetic License, whose fields knoweth no boundaries

The Relativistic License, whose frames reconcileth

The Cosmological License, which expandeth without limit

The Mathematical License, whose axioms bind thee

The Quantum License, which both permitteth and forbiddeth until witnessed

And it shall come to pass that all may code in peace, without fear of lawsuits or marketing departments.
