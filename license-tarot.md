# Hyperion Gray License Tarot

Sometimes you don’t want a legal decision tree.  
Sometimes you want **vibes**.

Draw a card (or several) and see which license archetype calls to you.

---

## Card I – The Researcher (HGOSL-Weak-1.0)

**Keywords:** Freedom, curiosity, safe harbor, tinkering  
**Upright:** Encourages exploration, fosters a healthy ecosystem, grants broad permissions while protecting good-faith researchers.  
**Reversed:** Corporate panic, overreliance on NDAs, pretending security through obscurity is enough.

**Meaning:**  
If this card appears, you probably want a **permissive** license that still explicitly defends people who poke at your stuff to make it better.

---

## Card II – The Shield (HGOSL-Strong-1.0)

**Keywords:** Protection, boundary, ethics, partial copyleft  
**Upright:** Keeps researcher rights attached to the code wherever it goes; demands that downstream users respect the same ethical floor.  
**Reversed:** Legal overcomplication, risk-averse counsel trying to neuter the terms.

**Meaning:**  
You want your work to be **borrowed responsibly**, and you’re okay with a bit of viral behavior as long as it’s about ethics, not control.

---

## Card III – The Field (HGEL-1.0)

**Keywords:** Forces, interaction, core vs periphery  
**Upright:** Recognizes that some parts of the system are core, others peripheral; propagates protections like a field through dependent modules.  
**Reversed:** Overengineering, drawing unnecessarily complex architecture diagrams to justify your licensing choices.

**Meaning:**  
You think in **systems**, not files. You want differential obligations based on how “close” something is to the core.

---

## Card IV – The Relativist (HGRL-1.0)

**Keywords:** Frames, observers, velocity  
**Upright:** Accepts that vendors, researchers, and regulators see things differently, but enforces researcher protections across all frames.  
**Reversed:** “But from *our* perspective…” weaponized as an excuse.

**Meaning:**  
You care about **context** and impact. Higher velocity and broader deployment should carry higher transparency and clearer ethics.

---

## Card V – The Cosmologist (HGΛ-1.0)

**Keywords:** Expansion, ratchet, horizon  
**Upright:** Researcher rights can only grow stronger across forks; the ecosystem becomes more protective over time.  
**Reversed:** Attempts to shrink rights; closed ecosystems that repel community improvements.

**Meaning:**  
You see your project as part of an expanding universe. You want downstream forks to **make things better**, not worse, for researchers.

---

## Card VI – The Mathematician (HGML-1.0)

**Keywords:** Axioms, proofs, rigor  
**Upright:** Clean definitions, logical constraints, potentially formalizable in theorem provers.  
**Reversed:** Bikeshedding about notation, arguments over whether “⊆” was the right choice.

**Meaning:**  
You want your license to be something a grad student could, in principle, **prove theorems about**. You enjoy pain.

---

## Card VII – The Quantum (HGQL-1.0)

**Keywords:** Superposition, paradox, collapse  
**Upright:** Embraces ambiguity and contradiction, but always resolves in favor of researcher protection.  
**Reversed:** Misinterpretation by people who don’t get the joke, or take it *too* seriously.

**Meaning:**  
You enjoy the fact that your license can be **both permissive and restrictive** depending on who’s looking; you want to encode that reality.

---

## Card VIII – The Interpreter (Programmatic Addendum)

**Keywords:** Code, meta, simulation  
**Upright:** A Python file that “decides” whose interpretation wins, leaning toward Hyperion Gray and researchers.  
**Reversed:** Someone attempts to present the Python module as actual legal authority.

**Meaning:**  
You want your repo to contain a **runnable joke** that explains the spirit of the license better than a wall of text.

## How To Use The Deck

1. Think about your project.  
2. Shuffle mentally (or scroll wildly).  
3. Stop and pick a card.  
4. Read the meaning.  
5. Check out the corresponding license text in:  
   - `THE_HYPERION_GRAY_BOOK_ON_LICENSING.md`

If in doubt, remember:  
> The card that makes you laugh is probably the right one.
