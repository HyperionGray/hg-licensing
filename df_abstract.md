CFP ABSTRACT (ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE ON PURPOSE)
Title:

The Hyperion Gray Book on Licensing: Why Legal Text Should Be Written by People Who Hate Law

Abstract:

In this talk, we will explore why traditional software licenses are boring, wrong, outdated, possibly cursed, and definitely not optimized for the modern security researcher whose biggest threat is not hackers but corporate legal departments with too much caffeine.

We present the Hyperion Gray License Multiverse, a suite of licensing structures created by blending actual legal disclaimers with physics metaphors, cosmology, eldritch math, and at least one valid Python script that pretends to resolve disputes by collapsing a quantum interpretation waveform. No lawyers were harmed in the creation of these licenses, but several expressed confusion, fear, and in one case, admiration bordering on resignation.

Attendees will learn:

Why MIT is fine but boring,

Why GPL makes sense only if you’ve never worked with other humans,

Why retaliation against security researchers is cringe behavior,

How to select a license using a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure engine,

How the Cosmological License guarantees researcher protections expand faster than the heat death of your company’s bug bounty program,

How the Relativistic License ensures transparency increases the faster you ship garbage to production,

And how, if stuff gets really weird, the Quantum License ensures all interpretations simultaneously favor Hyperion Gray until observed by a legal arbiter (also in superposition).

The talk ends with a tarot reading for your startup’s licensing future.

We will also distribute the complete text of
“The Hyperion Gray Book on Licensing: A (Not Really) Legal Approach to Chaotic Licensing for the Aspiring Entrepreneur,”
which is exactly as serious as it sounds and will not help you in court.

Target Audience:
Anyone who has ever:

Been threatened with a cease-and-desist for saving a company from itself,

Wanted a software license that actually says what everyone means,

Wondered why lawyers keep shaking their heads at them,

Or just wants to watch someone set fire to the concept of “responsible disclosure” using legal metaphors stolen from physics textbooks.

Prerequisites:
None.
But a mild disdain for authority helps.

Takeaways:
You will leave this talk knowing less about software licensing than when you arrived,
but feeling MUCH better about it.

NOTE:
This abstract was written by a human in collaboration with an AI who—per the logs—“refuses to testify without legal counsel.”
