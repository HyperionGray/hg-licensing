CFP VARIANT #1 — GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT DOCUMENT (FAR COMPLIANT-ISH)

Title:
Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HG-404: Deployment of Multidomain Licensing Harmonization Architecture (MLHA)

Abstract:
Per the provisions of FAR 15.203(b), the Offeror (hereafter “Hyperion Gray”) submits this Technical Volume Proposal to support cross-agency alignment for vulnerability-disclosure lifecycle governance. The objective of this engagement is to evaluate, pilot, and operationalize an enterprise-ready Licensing Harmonization Architecture (LHA) suitable for deployment across Federal Civilian Executive Branch entities, DoD components, and authorized contractors operating under DFARS 252.204-7012 conditions.

The LHA consists of multi-vector licensing instruments, including HGOSL-Weak-1.0, HGOSL-Strong-1.0, HGEL-1.0, HGRL-1.0, HGΛ-1.0, HGML-1.0, and HGQL-1.0, all of which facilitate enhanced Cybersecurity Researcher Engagement Posture (CREP) compliance under OMB M-21-31 and related memoranda. These instruments ensure cross-domain interpretational consistency, promote operator-aligned disclosure protocols, and minimize escalatory retaliatory actions inconsistent with executive guidance on coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD).

Hyperion Gray further proposes to supply a Programmatic Interpretation Engine (PIE), a Python-script-based Deterministic Interpretational Framework (DIF) compliant with Section 508 accessibility requirements to the extent practical.

Acceptance of this proposal shall not be construed as legal advice per FAR 52.237-3.
