Titanus Hyperionus (his full legal name) is an internationally unrecognized thought-leader in Adversarial Ethical Quantum Compliance, Meta-Operational Governance, and Cross-Domain Paranormal Security Research Enablement Frameworks. With over 17+ years of experience in Enterprise Vulnerability Ontology Modulation, Hyperion has consulted informally, non-bindingly, and often without invitation across sectors including fintech, govtech, pyrotech, aquatech, paratech, and “miscellaneous tech.”

Their contributions include and are most definitely limited to:

Inventing the term Disclosure Compliance Velocity, which has since been used in at least one internal PowerPoint and therefore counts as an "industry standard". Not a good one, but one.

Co-authoring the unpublished whitepaper Toward a Unified Multi-Vector Safe Harbor Paradigm for Ambiguous Researcher Engagement: A Quantum Mechanical Take On Why Lawyers Are Assholes.

Pioneering the field of Relativistic Governance Synchronization, a discipline widely misunderstood and even more widely ignored.

Advising several Fortune 500 companies, sometimes effectively by complete coincidence.

Developing the Programmatic Interpretation Engine, a Python script that adjudicates interpretive precedence using conditional branches that technically execute.

They currently serve as the Chief Framework Synergist at Hyperion Gray Labs, where they lead strategic initiatives in Trans-Jurisdictional Vulnerability Disclosure Harmonization and Post-Compliance Researcher Alignment Architecture.

Hyperion’s work has been described as:

“Unnecessarily complex.”

“Possibly illegal in 12 countries. Certainly in one.”

"Oh my god, the horror"

“A bold misuse of metaphor.”

“Shockingly influential for something that might be satire.”

He has been ignored by some of the most influential people in infosec. 

When not redefining licensing paradigms, Hyperion enjoys writing long, rambling github issues that no one understands, participating in competitive whiteboard threat-modeling, and performing load-balancing rituals over Kubernetes clusters during solar eclipses.
