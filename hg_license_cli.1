.SH NAME
hg_license_cli \- a chaotic licensing decision support utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hg_license_cli
.br
Runs an interactive curses-free TUI-ish licensing oracle.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hg_license_cli
program provides end-user access to the Hyperion Gray Licensing Multiverse,\ 
a suite of experimental licensing schemas designed to protect good-faith
security researchers while increasing organizational confusion.

The CLI offers the following features:

.TP
.B 1) Interactive licensing chooser
Guides the user through a sequence of poorly justified yes/no prompts
intended to approximate a decision-making process.

.TP
.B 2) Tarot mode
Draws a "license card" representing the user's licensing destiny.
Interpretations may or may not be legally defensible.

.TP
.B 3) Exit
Attempts to terminate the program. After three attempts, the application
expresses disappointment and exits. Users may experience guilt.

.SH OPTIONS
None.
If you were expecting options, this is the wrong tool.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on successful license prophecy.  
Returns 1 if the user angers the interpreter.  
Returns 42 if the quantum licensing superposition collapses unexpectedly.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The tool ignores all environment variables, including those which might
improve its behavior.

.SH BUGS
It should probably not exist.

.SH AUTHOR
